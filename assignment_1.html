        This text is not inside an element.<br>There is a line break before the start of this sentence and they will be used in these non element texts. The next 6 lines are Headers.
        <h1>Header 1 has a youtube video that won't load properly but it uses the iframe html element.<br>
            <br>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://youtu.be/BBJa32lCaaY?si=P7WJMsVALSGP4oXZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        Definitely not the best programmer but I'm trying. . .
        This text is not inside an element.<br>The next two lines of text are part of the paragraph element.
        
        <p>This is a paragraph 1</p>
        <p> This is paragraph 2</p>

        This text is not inside an element.<br> The list below is an ordered list. It will automatically count as 1. 2. 3. without it being explicity written in the code.
        <ol>
            <li>Fist item in the list</li>
            <li>Second item in the list</li>
            <li>Third item in the list</li>
        </ol>

        This text is not inside an element.<br>  The list below is an unordered list. It will add bullet points without being written manually in the code.
        <ul>
            <li>This is bullet point 1</li>
            <li>This is bullet point 2</li>
            <li>This is bullet point 3</li>
        </ul>

        This text is not inside an element. <br>
        The text below is an data definition list. Abreviated dl in the element. Inside the "dl" there are data terms("dt") and data definitions("dd").
        Data Terms are like the word ina dictionary and the Data definitions are like the definition next to the word in the dictionary. Caution! ddl's are organized strangely on screen.
        <dl>
            <dt>A word.</dt>
            <dd> Definition of a word</dd>
            <dt>Example: Key</dt>
            <dd>Example: Value</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>This text is part of a paragraph. Since my explanations are getting longer they will now be part of paragraphs elements.<br>
        The next html element after this paragraph will bethe anchor element. The main use of the anchor element will be to link other pages/websites.<br>
        The anchor element uses letter "a". This is an example of the syntax without the open and close brackets: a href = "www.pastelinkhere.com" /a</p>

        <a href="https://www.google.com"> This text will appear as the hyperlink to google. This is also an example of an absolute path</a>

        <p>The next hyperlink is a relative path to a file stored somewhere on the computer that it was created on. So it is only accessible while on that computer.</p>
        <a href="relative_path_link.html"> This is a relative path hyperlink. <br>
        If we see the source code you will notice that the full file path to where this file is located is not necessary</a>



    <br><br><br>
    <p>The next link is a fragment identifier<br></p>        
    <a href="#top">This is the fragment identifier. It works similarly to the anchor element syntax.It uses the # sign followed by top or bottom depending on what it's set to. <br>
    By clicking this link you will be redirected to the top of the page.</a>
    <div id="bottom">This is the bottom of the page.</div>
    </body>

    </html>
